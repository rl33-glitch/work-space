# Work space
The world we live in today is vastly different to the one we lived in a few short years ago. With many companies switching to a fully remote commercial enviroment in the aftermath of covid. It is a cheaper model for companies as they dont have to provide and maintain office space for its employees. But what about the employees? I for one dont enjoy working from home as i find my days structure to be negatively effected with working in the same enviroment i live in. This is where **workspace** comes in. It will be a platform to advertise and rent any space which would be suitable for a comfortable office enviroment.
