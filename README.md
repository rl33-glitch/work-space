# Work space
The world we live in today is vastly different to the one we lived in a few short years ago. With many companies switching to a fully remote commercial enviroment in the aftermath of covid. It is a cheaper model for companies as they dont have to provide and maintain office space for its employees. But what about the employees? I for one dont enjoy working from home as i find my days structure to be negatively effected with working in the same enviroment i live in. This is where **workspace** comes in. It will be a platform to advertise and rent any space which would be suitable for a comfortable office enviroment.

Welcome to the journey through [Workspace.](https://rl33-glitch.github.io/work-space/index.html)

# Wireframes

The Workspace wireframes was developed using the software [Balsamiq](https://balsamiq.com/). The wireframe provide a view for desktop and mobile devices of the four pages (Home page, Locations, Contact Us, and Get Started).

# Features

The Workspace website was developed to be a seamless and intuitive experience. By using  familiar features I intented to provide the customer with a efficient, smooth, and enjoyable experience. I kept consistency through the look and feel of the webpages structure across all pages and breakpoints.

### Navigation

- Featured at the top of the page, the navigation bar shows at the left corner of the Workspaces logo that also links to the index.html page.
- The navigation bar also provide the users with links to the remaining pages. The links located in the middle of the navigation bar are How it works, Locations, and Contact Us which link to different pages and sections of the same page.
- The navigation bar also provide the users with the button "Get Started" that gives the uses the option of log in or create a new account.

# Testing

The **Workspace** site code has been tested through the [W3C HTML Validator](https://validator.w3.org/), and the [W3C CSS Validator](https://jigsaw.w3.org/css-validator/). Minor errors were found on the homepage, locations page and contact us page. After a fix and retest, no errors were found.

The HTML validator results for each page presented below:
  - Homepage

### Acessibility
I confirmed that the colors and fonts chosen are easy to read and accessible by manually running a  test lighthouse in [Google Chrome DevTools](https://developer.chrome.com/docs/devtools/).
- Lighthouse
  The site was also tested using [Google Lighthouse](https://developers.google.com/web/tools/lighthouse)
    - **Performance** - How the page performs while loading.
    - **Accessibility** - Is the site accessible for all users and how can it be improved.
    - **Best Practices** - Site conforms to industry best practices.
    - **SEO** - Search engine optimisation. Is the site optimised for search engine result rankings.

  The **Workspace** results home page are presented below:
  <img width="642" alt="Screenshot 2022-03-13 at 00 02 39" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/67274642/158039618-9fff50b0-b27b-45c9-9c98-8d213cc6aad2.png">
  The test shows that the site is slow to load, mainly due to the images sizes. All the images will be need to be compressed before added to the repository.

### Browser Compatibility
The **Workspace** site was tested with no visible issues for the user on the following browsers: Google Chrome, Microsoft Edge, Safari and Mozilla Firefox. Appearance, functionality and responsiveness were consistent throughout for a range of device sizes and browsers.
